Microscope HTML viewer and light driver

Collection of little software pieces I use with a cheap microscope (which is basically a web camera with a different lens) and my 3D printed microscope holder and RGB lamp. I made it as a tool for mouth blues harmonica setup, mainly for accurate embossing.

It currently has just two small parts:
* Simple HTML viewer, so far made in a Jupyter python notebook for easy tweaking
* ATtiny85 light driver used to set up my RGB opposit-side lamp (the microscope has it's own same-side white light)
